## Documentation a create a project in expo
**System requirements:**

-   [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/).
-   macOS, Windows (Powershell and  [WSL 2](https://expo.fyi/wsl)), and Linux are supported.

We recommend starting with the default project created by  `create-expo-app`. The default project includes example code to help you get started.

To create a new project, run the following command:

    npx create-expo-app@latest

    
After issuing this command, the terminal will display the following message: Need to install the following packages:

    create-expo-app@3.4.2
    Ok to proceed? (y)

You must type y to proceed.
It will start creating the project, but first it will display the following message asking you to name your project: 

    Creating an Expo project using the default template.
    
    To choose from all available templates (https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/templates) pass in the --template arg:

    ? What is your app named? Â» my-app

After naming the project and pressing enter, it will create the project with all the necessary files.
