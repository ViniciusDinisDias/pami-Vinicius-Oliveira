## Documentation a create a project in expo
**System requirements:**

-   [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/).
-   macOS, Windows (Powershell and  [WSL 2](https://expo.fyi/wsl)), and Linux are supported.

We recommend starting with the default project created by  `create-expo-app`. The default project includes example code to help you get started.

To create a new project, run the following command:

    npx create-expo-app@latest
